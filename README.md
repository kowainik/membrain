This package implements type-safe memory units. It pursues the following goals:

1. Focus on correctness.
2. Low amount of boilerplate should be required to use the library.

The ideas behind this package are described in the following blog post:

 * [Insane in the Membrain](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/membrain)

The library is built around the following data type:

```haskell
newtype Memory (mem :: Nat) = Memory
    { unMemory :: Natural
    }
```

This data type stores every memory internally as bits. However, unit multiplier
is stored as type-level natural number. This approach allows to represent
different units and implement instances for them with low amount of boilerplate.

`membrain` implements various useful functions to work with `Memory`:

1. Smart constructors.
2. Conversion functions.
3. Pretty displaying.
4. Dependently-typed parsing.
5. Numeric functions.
6. Type-safe wrappers around functions from `base`.
